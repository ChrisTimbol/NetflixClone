## Netflix Clone
A Netflix-like list application that displays movies by section, with full user authentication, once users are logged in they can 'like' shows to add to there favorite show listing! Users can not actually watch videos with this app.
- uses https://www.themoviedb.org/ for film data.

## Motivation 
I built this project to better my knowledge in tailwindcss, firebase and user authentication. 

## What I Learned
  Tailwind CSS and 
  - Tailwind improved readability for me due to having the styling in the same place as the jsx
  - quicker results not having to flip to css files

  NextJS make it easier to get a project together quick
  - NextJS made datafetching easier thanks to getStaticProps()
  - Easy page navigation ( don't need react-router) , useRouter was useful for redirecting
  - NextJS image optimization was hard to work with for image background
  Firebase 
  - firebase is powerful and can get up and running in minutes 

## Framework/Libraries used
 Built with 
 - React 
 - NextJS 
 - TailwindCSS
