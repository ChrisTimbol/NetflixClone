## Netflix Clone
A Netflix-like application that displays movies by section, with full user authentication, once users are logged in they can 'like' shows to add to there favorite show listing!

## Motivation
I built this project mainly to better my knowledge in tailwindcss, firebase and user authentication.

## Getting Started

#### Check out live site at [https://chrisnetflixclone.vercel.app/]
#### or 

You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 8.0 or greater installed on your system.
```
npm install
```

Run the development server.
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
